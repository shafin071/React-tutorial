// React hook rules:
//      ðŸ”´ Do not call Hooks inside conditions or loops.
//      ðŸ”´ Do not call Hooks after a conditional return statement.
//      ðŸ”´ Do not call Hooks in event handlers.
//      ðŸ”´ Do not call Hooks in class components.
//            hooks can be called next to other hooks

// Computed values are values that shouldn't be managed as separate state since they can be derived from other state.

                     The Header component and Main tag are your a and b. So think of the div as an object that contains Header and Main.
                     Alternative to having a parent div element is to have Fragment element that does the same thing as div.
